# The IMDb Game
### An interactive trivia experience for users with an unusually large knowledge of film

## About the Project

This application is a web-based, interactive version of ‘The IMDb Game’ from the podcast “This Had Oscar Buzz?” created by Joe Reid and Chris Feil. The game, which is played at the end of every episode, tasks the player with guessing the top four titles associated with a given actor from the “known for” section of their IMDb* page.

*IMDb = Internet Movie Database

## APIs

This project uses both a local API [here](https://github.com/caleb-gore/The-IMDb-Game-API) on github, and a public API, [IMDB-API](https://imdb-api.com/).
The local API is used to store user data, including user profiles, game histories and category lists.  All movie based data is retrieved from IMDB-API.
